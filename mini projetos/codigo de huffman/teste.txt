**My Daily Routine**

Every day, I wake up early in the morning. I brush my teeth and wash my face. Then, I eat breakfast. After that, I go to work. At work, I have many tasks to complete. I enjoy my job because it is challenging and rewarding. During lunch, I eat with my colleagues. After work, I return home. In the evening, I like to relax by reading a book or watching TV. Before going to bed, I often study English to improve my skills. I believe that learning English will help me achieve my career goals.
